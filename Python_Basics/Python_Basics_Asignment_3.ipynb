A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function whereas A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope."

    "**Ans:** The Python return statement is a key component of functions and methods. We can use the return statement to make functions send Python objects back to the caller code. These objects are known as the functionâ€™s return value. A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression."

    "\n",
    "### 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "**Ans:** A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable. If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
